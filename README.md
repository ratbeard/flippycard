Two implementations of a memory game:

- The **classic** implementation is old.  Its global, obtrusive, procedural, and DOM-tastic.  Its bad.  It was my second javascript project a few years back, so don't make fun of me, okay?  It might be better than most implementations of this you'd find in javascript :p
- The **concrete** implementation is new, and becoming newer by the day.
- Placeholder for a 'modern' jQuery version, with a half-MVC javascript engine with a bridge to the DOM.
- Placeholder for the concrete version, with an alternate javascript syntax, i.e. macros. We're talking unicode macros too - Î» and something that expands `function () { return this`

I made the images :)  

If you're on Windows and symlinks don't work on Windows, copy `/shared` in to the implementation sub dirs and rename it to `resources`
