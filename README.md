=============

Two implementations of a memory game:

- The first is **CLASSIC**. It was my second JS project; its global, obtrusive, procedural, and DOM-tastic, making it an excellent candidate for the average JS implementation of this sort of thing.

- The second is **CONCRETE**. Its new, and getting newer by the day!  Its using the _hot_ NEW [Concrete ](http://ajaxian.com/archives/jquery-concrete-concreteui-programming-in-jquery#comments) jquery library.  

Some day there _might_ be:

- a 'modern' jQuery version, with a half-MVC javascript engine that bridges to the DOM.
- a concrete version with javascript macros. We're talking unicode characters too - λ, and something that expands to `function () { return this`


About Concrete Programming
==========================

Behavior (events and functions) are polymorphicaly dispatched based on the state of the view.

I'm not really sure!

Try it!

…

Comes from self's ‘morphic views’?  Javascript was greatly inspired by self?  Who knows!  Check out Effen and [concrete](http://github.com/hafriedlander/jquery.concrete) for javascript implementations.

Trouble
=======
Do symlinks work on windows?  If not, copy `/shared` in to the implementation sub dirs and rename it to `resources`
